Setting up filters for what items to destroy by smelting, burning, deconstructing, recycling etc. is always tedious.
I find I often have two or three recipies per bench to match all types of items.
To simplify this, the mod creates a useless and a non-useless filter to the Apparel and the Weapon lists.
The settings lets you define conditions that makes something useless.

Currently it has settings for 
[list]
[*] % Hit points
[*] Quality range
[*] Tainted/clean
[*] Biocoded/non-biocoded
[/list]

If any of the above settings match, it is considered useless. 
If not, its non-useless.

I created this mod mostly to simplify for myself, but hopefully someone else gets use out of it!
