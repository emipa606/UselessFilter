# UselessFilter

Setting up filters for what items to destroy by smelting, burning, deconstructing, recycling etc. is always tedious.
I find I often have two or three recipies per bench to match all types of items.
To simplify this, the mod creates a useless and a non-useless filter to the Apparel and the Weapon lists.
The settings lets you define conditions that makes something useless.

Currently it has settings for 


-  % Hit points
-  Quality range
-  Tainted/clean
-  Biocoded/non-biocoded



If any of the above settings match, it is considered useless. 
If not, its non-useless.

I created this mod mostly to simplify for myself, but hopefully someone else gets use out of it!
